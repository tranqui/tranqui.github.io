I'm a theoretical physicist with honorary/visiting positions at the Universities of Bristol and Mainz. I'm currently in the process of transitioning into a new role (to be announced).

Previously I held an Alexander von Humboldt fellowship at JGU Mainz, where I worked with the [Speck group](https://www.itp4.uni-stuttgart.de/) (now at Stuttgart). I was a PhD student at the University of Bristol, supervised by [Paddy Royall](https://paddyroyall.github.io/padrus/index.html).

My research spans a wide range of fundamental and applied topics in statistical physics and soft condensed matter. Some key areas of interest are:
* Liquid state theory and supercooled liquids, especially hard spheres.
* Structure formation, especially many-body correlations and patterns.
* Aerosol science and disease transmission through my long-term collaborators at the [Bristol Aerosol Research Centre](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/chemistry/research/barc/).

You can read more about my [research interests](/research) and find my [publications](/publications) on their respective pages.

My approach is often highly mathematical with a strong computational component. I've developed multiple [repositories](/repositories/) (mostly in C++/CUDA and Python) to carry out my research. Applied geometry is a recurring theme in my work.
