Broadly speaking, there have been three distinct "phases" to my research.

## 1. Pattern formation

In recent years I have become interested in structure formation in biology. Since early 2022 I have been trying to understand biological condensates as active droplets formed by liquid-liquid phase separation.
This work was made possible by an Alexander von Humboldt fellowship which allowed me to travel to Germany to collaborate with [Thomas Speck](https://www.itp4.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/Speck/).

I recently finished the first installment in this research program, which is available in this [recent preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02409).
This work was my most serious theoretical undertaking to date.
My approach forges an explicit connection between [Turing patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern) and field theories in active matter, which were previously considered as distinct paradigms.
In particular I have derived a universal limiting theory for pattern-formation in chemical systems that respect a conservation law.
This limiting theory reduces to "Active Model B+", a minimal active extension of the [Cahn-Hilliard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation), and describes pattern formation in a fully nonlinear fashion.


## 2. Aerosol science and disease transmission

TBD.

Previously I worked on the kinetics of aerosol droplets with applications to spray drying.


## 3. Liquid state theory and supercooled liquids

TBD.
