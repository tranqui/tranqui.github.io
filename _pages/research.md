Broadly speaking, there have been three distinct "phases" to my research.

## 1. Pattern formation

In recent years I have become interested in structure formation in biology. Since early 2022 I have been trying to understand biological condensates as active droplets formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. This approach forges an explicit connection between Turing patterns and field theories active matter, which were previously considered as distinct paradigms.


## 2. Aerosol science and disease transmission

TBD.

Previously I worked on the kinetics of aerosol droplets with applications to spray drying.


## 3. Supercooled liquids

TBD.
